# What to add.
- Add short intro
- Try to add [Get Started with official tutorial]() if that framework or library has a tutorial at their website.
- If they do not have official tutorial then only add written tutorial from other sources or if the tutorial at other source is extremely great then do add that too.
- Try to add free courses from youtube or any other place under section [Get started with videos]().
- Suggest a project is possible.
- Try to add core (essential) topics if there are any (ex Redux in React is nearly used by all projects).
---

- Do update links in content and todo also.
